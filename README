This directory contains all the code that was written while Ledger was being
ported to Common Lisp in 2007-2008.  I'm keeping the history of it in the
repository for archival reasons.

To view the code, you must first checkout the submodule as follows:

  $ git submodule init
  $ git submodule update

Or, you can check out the individual sub-projects using the following tags:

  cambl-20080203
  periods-20080201
  cl-ledger-20080203
  red-black-20071213
